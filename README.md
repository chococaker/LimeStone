# LimeStone Redstone Simulator

*Art by [@SublimedLime](https://github.com/SublimedLime)!*

LimeStone is a **Minecraft Redstone simulator**, built to let players experiment with contraptions outside of the game itself.

We spent countless hours digging into the Minecraft Wiki and playtesting, ensuring our simulator behaves as close to true Minecraft Redstone as possible.

If it works in vanilla Minecraft (in 2D), you can build it here, from a Redstone lamp array to a full-on chess engine.

## What’s Next

Here’s what we’re planning for the future of LimeStone:

* **Interactive Tutorials**
  A step-by-step guide to help beginners understand the fundamentals of Redstone, with hands-on lessons inside the simulator.

* **Graphics & Polish**
  Particle effects, smoother animations, and visual feedback to bring contraptions to life.

* **Infinite Zoom & Scaling**
  No more manually setting `height` and `width` in `script.js`. You’ll be able to zoom in/out with the scroll wheel for massive builds.

* **More Components**
  While most of the Redstone toolkit is here, we’re still finishing up a few key blocks:

  * **Honey Blocks** essential for advanced SlimeStone machines (coming soon).
  * **Container Blocks** Droppers, Dispensers, Chests, all useful blocks in highly complex tasks.
