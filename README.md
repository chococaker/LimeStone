| Some Python code lives in the repo — not because LimeStone *needs* it to run, but because we used it to **generate assets** (e.g., transforming textures into their different states). Think of it as a behind-the-scenes tool chest left in for reference. |

## 🎮 What is LimeStone?

LimeStone is a **Minecraft Redstone simulator**, built to let players experiment with contraptions outside of the game itself.

Whether you’re a tinkerer testing a complex Redstone clock or a kid learning the basics of circuits, LimeStone makes the process **accessible, faithful, and fun**.

We spent countless hours digging into the Minecraft Wiki and playtesting, ensuring our simulator behaves as close to *true* Minecraft Redstone as possible — quirks and all.

If it works in vanilla Minecraft (in 2D), you can build it here. From a glowing Redstone lamp array to a full-on Redstone chess engine — the only limit is your **RAM** and your **imagination**.

## 🚀 What’s Next

Here’s what we’re planning for the future of LimeStone:

* 📘 **Interactive Tutorials**
  A step-by-step guide to help beginners understand the fundamentals of Redstone, with hands-on lessons inside the simulator.

* ✨ **Graphics & Polish**
  Particle effects, smoother animations, and visual feedback to bring contraptions to life.

* 🔍 **Infinite Zoom & Scaling**
  No more manually setting `height` and `width` in `script.js` — you’ll be able to zoom in/out with the scroll wheel for massive builds.

* 🧩 **More Components**
  While most of the Redstone toolkit is here, we’re still finishing up a few key blocks:

  * **Honey Blocks** 🧃 — essential for advanced SlimeStone machines (coming soon).
  * **Sticky Pistons** 🟩 — almost done, just polishing off bug fixes.
  * **Comparators** 🔴 — currently being drafted to round out the Redstone logic set.

## 🌟 Why We Built It

We wanted to create something that feels approachable to kids learning about circuits, but powerful enough for Redstone veterans to push the limits. LimeStone is equal parts **educational tool** and **sandbox playground** — bridging Minecraft’s creativity with real-world engineering concepts.
